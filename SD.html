                <li>Coding. Our clients don't all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a developer, we're looking for a breadth of experience in a variety of languages, and experience in one or two: Java, javascript, and React are high on our list. (Other notables: Python,Ruby, Scala, .NET, Clojure.)</li>
                <li>You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration and pair programming.</li>
                <li>Understanding and playing a part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery (ideation, project conception, UX, code, testing, deployment, and around again)</li>
                <li>Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.</li>
